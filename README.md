# Iraq-HOI4-cold-war-iron-curtain-a-world-divided
This patch is working with Hearts of Iron 4, Cold War Iron Curtain a World Divided and it will add real designs to the Infantries and the armored divisions.

Installing the mode:-
You should go to this path "Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\1458561226_cold_war_iron_curtain_a_world_divided\gfx" after that you have two steps

A- copying all entitles codes to the mod files.
B- in the same file gfx you should go the file called "models" then "units" then all you have to do is copying and pasting all the files that I have uploaded in my units file.



Conjarts  the patch should work properly now.
